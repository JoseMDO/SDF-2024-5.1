## Daily Impressions
- Young is always very professionally dressed. 
- Natalie went above and beyond on the Must See Movie helper methods modules. Natalie wanted more practice with her commit messages and frequency, and wanted to refactor some of the code by hand. Natalie created a pull request and had me review it to provide her feedback on how she did. This was not a requirement of the assignment but it showed Natalie appreciates feedback and wants to grow and learn more. Great job Natalie, keep up the good work!

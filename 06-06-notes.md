## Daily Impressions
- Kurt likes to participate, asks me question, wants to be active in class and is very respectful. Kurt always doubles checks with me to see if he is missing anything. This shows he cares deeply about making sure things are done correctly. Great job and keep up the good work! 
- Chenemelum took charge at one point during the fun fact merge assignment. She got in front of the class and started a group huddle to get the merge issues sorted out. Great way showing some initiative to take charge and show leadership!
- Fadi has been very interactive with me since joining the classroom. Fadi is not afraid to ask questions and was very quick to adapt to the classroom environment and his peers even though he started later than everyone else. Keep up the great work Fadi!
